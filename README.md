# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a yearly challenge with 25 daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December.

## Programming Language

I have experimented with different programming languages to solve these puzzles, but Python has proven to be the most suited for this kind of tasks. I know that Python is not the fastest language, but that challenges me to optimize my solutions in that regard. I have also experimented with Swift, which is the language I work with every day, but doing a lot of input parsing and string manipulation is often a bit cumbersome.

So far, I have used the following programming languages:

* 2015: Python
* 2016: Python
* 2017: *not started yet*
* 2018: Python
* 2019: Swift
* 2020: Python
